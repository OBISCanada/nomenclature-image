# Context 
This repo outlines naming conventions for acquired images for the purpose of evaluating biodiversity during field missions at the Institut Maurice Lamontagne (IML).
The most practical naming convention will vary with different situations as well as applications.
For archival purposes for example, filenames may be changed to follow a different templating scheme.
However, other use-cases may benefit from following a similar template.

At this current iteration, the naming scheme is still under constant evolution.
Edge cases are discovered and the template is tweaked accordingly. We welcome any comments/suggestions.
